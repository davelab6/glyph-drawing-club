=====================

### Run the example

```
npm install
npm start
```

### To-do

* Selection tool works, but needs to be visible (currently SelectionHighlight.js WIP)
* Selected area: mirror, transpose (rotate) working correctly
* Select page number to update when pressed prev/next
* Glyph offset x & y are a bit unintuitive
* Pan & Zoom canvas (move up&down, left&right, zoom, center)
* "Reset to default" button offset y is incorrect

#### In the future (maybe)

* Export as vector data
* Typing mode
* Undo/redo functionality
* Color tool
* Gallery, where users can upload their creations
* Frames (to make animation)
* Real textmode with UTF
